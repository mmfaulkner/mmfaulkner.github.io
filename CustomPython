To create a directory with your custom python functions, go to your home directory:
cd ~
mkdir custom_python
Now give python access to your custom function directory. From your home directory, open your (hidden) .zprofile or .profile file and add a line
export PYTHONPATH=<home directory>/custom_python
It's important that your spaces match the above.
Now activate these changes to your profile with
source ~/.zprofile
Now python can access your custom function directory. Let's add a custom function. Go back to your custom_python directory and create a file called test.py. Add a function to your test script, e.g.:
def hello():
  print('hello!')
Now go to some other directory, enter python, and try importing and calling your new function:
from test import hello
hello()
