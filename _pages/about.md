I am a PhD student in Princeton University's [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences program](https://aos.princeton.edu/). I am interested in Arctic Ocean physical oceanography, particularly western Arctic halocline dynamics and sea ice. I started my PhD in September 2021 and expect to finish in spring of 2027. In addition to my research, I hope to use my time at Princeton to learn how to teach in a way that not only effectively communicates topics, but also promotes an inclusive and supportive community and inspires students to love math and climate science.
